Text to persons
===============

Purpose
-------
Get an LLM API to do named entity recognition.


Task
----
Construct a Docker/Podman container that exposes a REST-based Web service
with a Python program running from port 8000 that extract person names
from a given text.
The endpoint should be `/v1/extract-persons` and with POST with field `text`.
The system can use the API from the CampusAI at
https//campusai.compute.dtu.dk with an appropriate prompt.

The Web service should return the response as JSON with a dictionary
with the field ``persons'' that is a list of strings. Where each
string is a name from the text.

If you use the LLM API you need a CAMPUSAI_API_KEY from the
CampusAI. You API keyy must NOT be included in the hand-in. Instead
put it in a `~/.env` file. and build and run the container with

```
docker build -t text-to-persons:latest .
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 --env-file ~/.env text-to-persons:latest
```
This way your API key stay on your computer (in the `.env` file) and
if others (e.g., me) should use your container/Webservice they need to
provide their own API key.


Testing
-------
When you have the Web server running you should be able access the
Swagger UI with you API documentation at

http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

There you can also test it.

With the Web service running you should also be able to do
```
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/extract-persons \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"text":"Einstein and von Neumann meet each other."}' | jq
```

If you construct a function called `campusai_extract_persons` then you
can test it with

```python

examples = [
   "Ms Mette Frederiksen is in New York today.",
   "Einstein and von Neumann meet each other."
]
expected = [
  ["Mette Frederiksen"],
  ["Einstein", "von Neumann"],
]

import os
from app import extract_persons

def test_examples_from_prompt():
    examples = [
        "Ms Mette Frederiksen is in New York today.",
        "Einstein and von Neumann meet each other.",
    ]
    expected = [
        ["Mette Frederiksen"],
        ["Einstein", "von Neumann"],
    ]
    for text, exp in zip(examples, expected):
        assert campusai_extract_persons(text) == exp
```
If the test is in a `test_` prefixed file you can run with `pytest`.


Questions
---------
Consider some issues

- **Should the CampusAI LLM API be used or is, e.g., spaCy better?**

Using the CampusAI LLM API is a good choice as it is more robust and can
detect names more accurately than traditional NLP tools such as spaCy.
However this also comes at an elevated cost in terms of time, computation,
and in some cases money.

- **What models are there on CampusAI?**

Deepseek-r1, gemma3, qwen3.

- **Should the LLM be called via a library or "directly" to the Web API.**

The LLM is called using the openai library.

- **What format should the prompt have?**

The prompt is a list of dictionaries where the key is either "role" or "content"
and the value is either system or assistant for the role, and the text input or response
for the content.

- **Are chain-of-thought, few-short prompting, etc. necessary?**

It is important to prompt properly and give clear instructions to the LLM, as sometimes
it does not return the output in the format that you want it and then causes the code to
crash. Giving examples helped me improve the success rate.
